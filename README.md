# Taking CSE 154: Web Programming at the University of Washington
Spring 2019

## Description
In Spring 2019, I took CSE 154 taught by Lauren Bricker and Melissa Hovik at the University of Washington. This course focused on developing web pages with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. We created web services and APIs (Application programming interfaces) in PHP and populated data in our web pages by fetching it through JavaScript from our APIs. My main takeaway from this course was the development of APIs and how they can integrate into bigger applications.
